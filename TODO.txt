Notebook 1: Random Forest
Perform forward selection (or backward elimination) with Random Forest.
Use metrics like MSE and AIC to select the best features.
Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization.
Identify the top 3 Random Forest models based on their performance.

Notebook 2: XGBoost
Conduct feature selection tailored to XGBoostâ€™s strengths (e.g., use XGBoost's built-in feature importance).
Optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, tree depth, and regularization terms.
Save the top 3 XGBoost models for comparison.

Notebook 3: LSTM
Engineer sequences (sliding windows) and perform feature selection tailored to temporal patterns.
Optimize hyperparameters like the number of neurons, layers, sequence length, and dropout rates.
Save the top 3 LSTM models with the best prediction performance.

Notebook 4: Model Comparison
Compare the top 9 models (3 from each type) using validation metrics.
Test the top 3 overall models on a real-world paper trading account.
Evaluate their actual performance in terms of profitability and robustness.
