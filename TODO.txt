Build live API readings:
Find api where we can get 5 or 10min or even more frequent EURUSD price readings
Build system that can receive these live readings

Deploy model and model-ecosystem:
deploy model.
deploy system that keeps track of "highest yet" and "lowest yet" readings
deploy system that scales input with StandardScaler
make prediction, inverse scale output, give closing prediction
give confidence interval-ish measure of how certain prediction is,
display time that highest/lowest reading was taken
display time until market close

Periodic retrain:
Build functionality that enables cmd line arguments to retrain model with latest
available data

Build csv performance tracking system:
Record each reading: Time, Price, Highest yet, Lowest yet, Prediction

Build a simple GUI mode with pygame:
show graph indicating live readings coming in,
highlight highest and lowest readings
highlight current close prediction
add a timer until next reading, timer until daily close
